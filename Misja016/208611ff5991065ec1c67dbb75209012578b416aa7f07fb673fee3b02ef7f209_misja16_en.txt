Agents 1337,

Our transgalactic fighter "Striker 0xdeafbeef" captured a suspicious message
that came from the direction of the "Colorful Planet". Our Cipher Department
managed to decode that transmission. Unfortunately, received image is unreadable
and contains weird artifacts.

We think that the real information is hidden. Your have to retrieve original
message.

Agents, failure is not an option here!

Â Â Â Â Captured stream: goo.gl/VNhhTW

Good luck!

Hint1: Files are not fragmented.
Hint2: The flag is clearly marked with ðŸš©
Hint3: Pay attention to window size settings and scale, they can change a lot.
Hint4: We suspect that the password can be really strong. It is not worth
       breaking it. However, we have a feeling that it is also contained in
       the message.
Hint5: Seriously, settings are really important.
