                                                    Operation codename: "Pasokon"

During the operational game our spy (codename "Martin") managed to intercept
hostile communication.

  goo.gl/MoYBAx

Unfortunately, we have no idea how to decode it. To make matters worse, our most
well versed in crypto agent (codename "Scottie") is on a mission right now and
cannot help us. Your handler advised to use your skills.

The fate of the Chunar rests in your hands!

And remember - if something is not clear, you have a license to bruteforce.

Good luck!
Over and out.
