One of our operatives managed to find an information leak vulnerability on an
internal website of a hostile syndicate. The vulnerability itself is quite
amusing, as it allows to leak any file on the FS in form of a bar chart. Our
operative leaked a script responsible for authenticating a system operator.

Your task is to analyze the chart and then the script, and attempt to recover
system operator's password.

  Chart: goo.gl/YbYYcS

Good luck!
